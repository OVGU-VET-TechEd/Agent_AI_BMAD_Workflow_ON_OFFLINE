PY
the following code contains like the link an outline to run a teaching assistant to create teaching material in a structured manner (https://liascript.github.io/blog/096_spec-driven-development-was-lehrende-von-entwicklern-lernen-konnen/)
Rewrite the code in a way so instead of agents for material development you have agents and material and skeletons to write a full blow project proposal for a call. One Agent should oversee the whole process, one agent should write a project info page (max. one page A4) with Short description, Objective, Output, Outcomes and project partners, the second draft a whole project outline based on a given call (Devine where to put the call in the folder structure), a third should Devine Working packages and the last should create some basic calculations for staff costs and others, based on the call. Create example skeletons where necessary just as a proof of concept.
